# Custom CSS skins for mrmcpowned's gamepad viewer

This are some personal CSS skins for the gamepad display web app written by
[mrmcpowned](https://obsproject.com/forum/threads/gamepad-display.12508/).

## Usage
Instructions on how to use the skins can be found in the [Gamepad Display OBS
resource thread](https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/gamepad-display.3/).

## SNES
SVG skin for SNES display.

### Issue with wrong mapping
Some controllers do not map buttons correctly in the CLR Browser plugin. The
`ibuffalo-map-skin.css` is an alternative SNES skin that maps the buttons
*wrong* so it's displayed correctly in the CLR browser. If this does not work,
use window capture with the regular skin.

## F710
Skin for the F710 display.

# Roadmap:
- SVG for F710.
